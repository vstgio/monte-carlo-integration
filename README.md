## Monte Carlo Integration
`EN`

This project brings an implementation in Python of an algorithm that calculates the definite integral of a function using the Monte Carlo method. The user can choose between using the NumPy library or not to calculate the definite integral, including to compare the runtime between the options. This project was developed as the introductory practice of the subject "Artificial Inteligence Applied to IoT", part of my master degree in Internet of Things at Universidade Complutense de Madrid, Spain.

As output, the code brings a set of informations in the terminal (such as limits of integration, random points, results, etc) and generates a visualization using the Matplotlib library. As a means of comparing the Monte Carlo method, the output also brings the result of the integration using the "quad" function from ScyPy library.
